# Project Description: News App

## Introduction

In this project, we will be building a news app using Flutter. The app will allow users to browse and read news articles from different categories such as sports, politics, entertainment, etc. We will be using the News API to fetch news articles in real-time.

## Features

The app will have the following features:

* Browse news articles from different categories.
* View news articles in a detailed view with an image, title, description, and source information.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies will be used to build this app:

* Flutter: Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It is used to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications for Android and iOS.
* Dart: Dart is a client-optimized programming language for building fast apps on any platform. It is used as the programming language for Flutter.
* News API: News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. We will be using the News API to fetch news articles in real-time.

## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

* Create a new Flutter project using ```flutter create news_app```.
* Add the **_http_** dependency to your **_pubspec.yaml_** file.
* Under the dependencies section, add the following line: ```http: ^0.13.4```
* Save the file and run the following command in your terminal: ```flutter packages get```
* You can now import and use the **_http package_** in your Flutter project. To import the package, add the following line at the top of your Dart file: ```import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;```
* Write code in file named **_main.dart_** in your lib folder. This file will contain the API calls to fetch news articles.

## NewApi Key Generation

1. Go to the News API website at <https://newsapi.org>.
2. Click on the **_"Get API Key"_** button on the homepage.
3. Sign up for a free account by providing your email address and creating a password.
4. Once you have signed up, you will be redirected to your News API dashboard.
5. Under the **_"API Keys"_** section, click on the "Create API Key" button in NOT AVAILABLE.
6. Give your API key a name (for example, "News App API Key") and select the plan that best suits your needs.
7. Agree to the News API terms and conditions.
Click on the "Create API Key" button.
8. Your API key will be generated and displayed on the dashboard. Make note of the key and keep it secure.

## Conclusion

In this project, we will learn how to use Flutter and Dart to build a real-world news app. We will learn how to fetch data from an API, parse JSON responses, and display data in a user-friendly interface. By the end of the project, we will have a fully functional news app that we can deploy to Android and iOS devices.
